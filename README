Specs for the input file.
The alist file has to contain the input graph with the following format:

The first line is an integer n, denoting the number of vertices in the graph. The n vertices are labeled from 0 to n-1 and we assume
that 0 is always the source and n-1 is the target vertex.

The next n lines contains the weighted adjacency matrix for the input graph. 
Line i contains the weight of edges going from vertex i to each of the other vertices, value 0 indicates that there is no edge between 
the corresponding vertices.

The next line is a list that represents the broken equipment at the start.
The last line is the vertex capacity for each vertex in the graph.

You can run the script via the following command:
python recovery_fs_v2.py input-file-path
